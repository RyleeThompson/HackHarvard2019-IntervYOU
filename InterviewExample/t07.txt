Okay. I saw myself as a pretty decent writer. I took a good amount of English classes in high schoolâ€”advanced English classes. Like I said, I 
enjoyed writing. It was something that I had confidence in, definitely. I noticed that when I took. It kind of came a little more easily to me than other students. Besides that, I didnt really frame myself too much as a writer at least at the start, because I didnt really know how to compare myself, I guess Id say.
